Problems:

Problem 1:
The frictionless pressure loss DP (in H2O) in a circular duct where air is flowing at a velocity V (ft min-1) is given by:
∆P = 0.027(L/d^1.22 )〖(V/V_0 )〗^1.82
where L is the length of the duct (ft) and d is the inside diameter (inches). 
	a) Determine the dimensions and units for the constant 0.027. V0 is a reference velocity with units of ft min-1. 
	b) A similar duct has an inside diameter of 10 cm and a length of 1.5 ft, with V/V0 = 2.5, what is the pressure loss in units of in H2O? 
Problem 2:
The Reynolds number is one of the most important dimensionless numbers used in fluid mechanics – it describes the balance between inertial and viscous forces and is used often to discern between laminar and turbulent flow: 
Re=ρvD/μ
Where ρ is the density, v is the average velocity of the fluid, D is the diameter of the pipe (or the equivalent hydrodynamic diameter) and m is the viscosity of the fluid. For water flowing at 20 oC in a pipe with a velocity of 15 ft s-1 and a diameter of 3 inches, determine Re. 
Problem 3:
A bubble is shown in Figure 1 where the bubble is expanding due to the pressure difference from inside to outside the bubble (p_0– pressure outside of the bubble; p_i= pressure inside the bubble). Resisting the expansion is the surface tension σ. 
 
Figure 1: Expansion of a bubble against the surface tension
	a) Determine the expression for the pressure inside the droplet. 
	b) If the surface tension is 50 mN m-1 and the bubble is 10 μm in diameter, determine the pressure required to keep the bubble stable (assume the atmospheric pressure is 1 atm). 
Problem 4: 
A fluid is placed between two parallel plates with a weight attached to the upper plate, which is pulled across with a cable (Figure 2). Given that the mass is 500 g, ∆y = 5 mm and the contact area is 1.2 m2 and assuming that steady state is achieved, determine the plate velocity for the following two cases: 
	a) Assume the fluid is Newtonian, with a viscosity of 1.5 Pa×s. 
	b) Assume that the fluid is a Bingham fluid described by the following constitutive equation for the stress t as a function of the shear rate dv/dy. τ=τ_0+μ_0  dv/dy(in 1-dimensional flow) where τ_0 is the yield stress required for the material to start flowing and μ0 is the viscosity. For this particular fluid, take τ_0= 20 Pa and μ_0= 55 x 10-3 Pa*s.

Problem 5:
A set of concentric cylinders is arranged with one cylinder placed inside another, with the inner cylinder having a radius of 0.12 m and the outer cylinder having a radius of 0.13 m (Figure 3). Both cylinders are 0.3 m long. A torque M is applied on the inner cylinder surface of 0.88 N×m to keep the inner cylinder turning at an angular velocity ω=2π rad s-1. What is the viscosity of the fluid between the cylinders? Assume the fluid is Newtonian and take the gap between the cylinders to be small.

Problem 6:
There are many rheometer designs used to measure rheological properties of fluids, particularly useful for non-Newtonian fluids. One example is the cone and plate viscometer shown in the figure below. It is particularly useful as it as a homogeneous flow (the stress measured is not a function of position; this is important if you study rheology further). The cone-and-plate rheometer consists of a flat lower plate and an upper rotating cone (shown rotating at an angular velocity ) with a very obtuse angle (typically θ is less than 0.5o). Below is the data from measurements made on the cone-and-plate rheometer provided from Problem 2.29 in Fox & McDonald 10th ed. Use this data to determine what kind of non‐Newtonian fluid is, assuming it is like a power law fluid with consistency index m and n. Take θ = 0.5o and predict the viscosity at 90 and 100 RPM.

η(N∙s/m^2)	0.121	0.139	0.153	0.159	0.172	0.172	0.183	0.185
	a) Derive an expression for the velocity gradient(¶v_r)/(¶y) as a function of the angular velocity 
and the cone angle θ.
	b) Develop a relationship between the N (RPM) given and the velocity gradient derived in a). 
	c) Use the power law expression for viscosity h to determine the consistency index m and the power law parameter n. What kind of fluid (reheologically) is suggusted?
η=m〖((¶v_r)/(¶y))〗^(n-1)





Problem 7:
Fox & McDonald Example 3.2 – inclined tube manometer. In this example, fluid is filled inside a tank from which a tube is positioned at an angle of incline q. You are asked to determine the applied pressure ∆P as a function of liquid deflection L. 
 
Figure 6: Figure for Example 3.2 from Fox and McDonald
After determining ∆P(L), estimate the sensitivity of the manometer, which is obtained by 
comparing the deflection L with the deflection (or rise) h of a simple U-tube manometer, relative 
to water: h=∆P/(ρ_w g) where ρ_(w )is the density of water. 
Problem 8:
The following tank system consists of heptane in a tank whose gauge pressure reads 11.7 kPa (the pressure of air in the tank). For the readings shown, determine the unknown fluid specific gravity s (with density "ρ" _"s " ).

ANSWERS:

Problem 1:
	∆P (Pa) = 0.027 ((L (ft))/(d^1.22 (〖inches〗^1.22)))∙〖(V/V_0 )〗^1.82= ((i〖nches〗^1.22)/ft)∙〖((ft/min)/(ft.min))〗^1.82, so the unit of 0.027 should be: ((i〖nch〗^1.22)/ft)
	L=1.5ft=45.72cm; d=10cm; v/v_(0=2.5)
∆P=(0.027∙(45.72/10^1.22 )∙〖2.5〗^1.82) Pa=0.3942 Pa
So the pressure loss is H2O is 0.3942 Pa
Problem 2:
Re=ρvD/μ=998.23  kg/m^3 ∙1/1.005cP∙15 ft/s∙3in∙ft/12in∙(10^3 cP)/(1 kg/(m∙s))∙m^2/(〖3.2808〗^2 〖ft〗^2 )=3.5×10^5
Problem 3:
a): this expression can be determined by a force balance between the force on the bubble expanding and the force holding back the bubble expansion (the interfacial tension).
P_bubble=P_i-P_0=Force/Area=Force/(πR^2 )
Thus, the force F for the bubble expansion is:
F=πR^2 (P_i-P_0)
Resisting the bubble expansion is the interfacial tension, which is the force along the contact line, in this case the circumference of sphere.
σ=Force/2πR so F=2πRσ
A force balance thus leads to the following expression for the pressure inside the bubble.
πR^2 (P_i-P_0)=2πRσ
P_i-P_0=2σ/R
Using the given values, we can determine the pressure inside the bubble.
An alternative method to arrive at the same solution can be obtained by examine the work done to create the surface.
work=d(Aσ)=σd(4πR^2)=8πσR dR
Thus, force=8πRσ a since work=force×distance=F×dR
The forces on the inside and outside of the bubble are across the surface areas of the spheres: 
F_i=AP_i=4πR^2 P_i.
Taking the thin film approximation (the film thickness is quite small) so F_i=AP_0=4πR^2 P_0.
Doing a force balance gives: 4πR^2 P_0+8πσR=4πR^2 P_i and the results is the same as above.
P_i=P_0+2σ/R=1atm+2/10μm∙50 mN/m∙(10^6 μm)/m∙N/1000mN∙m^2/101325N∙1atm=1.1atm
Problem 4:
a): τ=μ dv/dy=μ V/∆y; so V=τ∆y/μ
we can determine the stress from the force of the weight and the contact area provided.
τ=F/A=0.5kg/(1.2m^2 )∙9.81 m/s^2 ∙(Ns^2)/(kg m)=4.0875  N/m^2 
V=τ∆y/μ=4.0875 N/m^2 ∙1/(1.5Pa∙s)∙5mm=13 mm/s
b): in this case, the applied stress is about 4 Pa, but the yield stress is given as 20 Pa. Thus, the fluid will not flow unless the yield stress is exceeded. The velocity of the plate would be zero.
Problem 5: 
We can relate the torque to the force, and ultimately the stress that the fluid is exerting on the cylinder walls.
M=(τ∙2πrL)r=2τLr^2; hence τ=M/(2πLr^2 ).
We know that the fluid is Newtonian so that τ=μ dv/dy=M/(2πLr^2 ) so dv/dy≈dv/dr=M/(2μπLr^2 ).
We take the negative of the velocity gradient, as we picked the coordinate system such that as the radial position increases, the velocity decreases. 
Separating variables and solving for velocities (which we are given) as a function of radial position gives: -dv/dr=M/(2μπLr^2 )
-∫_(v_i)^(v_o)▒dv=∫_(r_i)^(r_0)▒M/(2μπLr^2 ) dr 
Hence, v_i-v_o=M/2μπL(1/r_i -1/r_0 )
The inner cylinder velocity is v_i=(2π rad s^(-1))0.12=0.754 m∙s^(-1)
Solving for viscosity gives: 
μ=1/(v_i-v_0 )  M/2πL(1/r_i -1/r_0 )=1/((0.754 m/s-0))  (0.88 N∙m)/(2π∙0.3m)(1/0.12m-1/0.13m)=0.397 Pa∙s≅0.40 Pa∙s
Problem 6:
a): First, use the definition of velocity to determine the velocity gradient. Linear speed = r. Next, from the geometry of the cone, tanθ=y/r.
Thus, (v_r)/y≅( r.)/(r∙tanθ). Further for small θ, as is the case here, tanθ≅θ so (v_r)/y≅( .)/θ
b): The angualr velociry  can be related to N (RPM=revolutions per minute) via the following to get it in units of rad s-1.  =2πN/(60 sec). Further, ( )/θ=2πN/(60 sec)  rad/s∙(360°)/(π rad)  [=]s^(-1).
c): We can now plot the shea rate [=] with viscosity and fit a power law model to extract the consistency index and the power law parameter.
Plotting the viscosity directly as shear rate shows that it is decreasing as function of shear rate – The fluid is shear-thickening (dilatant).
 
After plotting in logarithmic coordinates as power law model, the consistency index is 0.045 Pa∙s^n and n=1.21, confirming indeed that the fluid is shear thickening (n>1).

Problem 7:
Like a typical manometer problem, we look where the fluid liquid levels are equal in both arms 
and then do a balance.
∆P=ρ_L g(h_1+h_2)
From the manometer geometry on the incline: sinθ=h_2/L; h_2=L sinθ
We can also eliminate h_1 using a mass balance. (πD^2)/4 h_1=(πd^2)/4 L so h_1=L〖(d/D)〗^2
Elinminating h_1 and h_2 gives the following: 
∆P=ρ_L g(h_1+h_2)=ρ_L gL(〖(d/D)〗^2+sinθ)
L=∆P/(ρ_L g(〖(d/D)〗^2+sinθ))
The sensitivity is given as a ratio of L  to h.
sensitivity=s=L/h=(∆P/(ρ_L g(〖(d/D)〗^2+sinθ)))/(∆P/(ρ_w g))=1/(〖SG〗_L [〖(d/D)〗^2+sinθ])
Where 〖SG〗_L is the specific gravity.
Problem 8:
1): P_1+ρ_H g(3cm)=P_2
2): P_2=ρ_s g(7cm)+P_3
3): P_4+ρ_Hg g(8.5cm)=P_3
Note the subscripts refer to the point labeled in the diagram. The densities of the various fluids are denoted as: ρ_H=density of heptane=681 kg m-3; ρ_Hg= density of mercury=13600 kg m-3 and ρ_s is the density of unknown fluid s.
We are also given the pressure inside the tank as 11.7 kPa, which is the gauge pressure. The pressure difference P_1-P_4=11.7 kPa as P_4 is the atmospheric pressure. 
We can now solve for the system of equations 1)to 3) to determine the density of the unknown fluid combining equations 2) and 3) gives:
P_2=ρ_s g(7cm)+P_3=ρ_s g(7cm)+P_4+ρ_Hg g(8.5cm)
Now, subsitute equations 1) for
